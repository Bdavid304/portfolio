# portfolio

This project helps people understand compound interest and how their investments can grow over time. 

A part that I think I did well is allowing the options to update info without having to restart the program. 
You can change anything using the menu options and imediately see how it effects the investment.

A part that I think could be improved upon is that if you enter an input other than a number it can break the loop. 
I tried to find a way around this, but at the time it would have taken too much time to fix this problem.

I think it is a very well organized project and makes good use of functions and loops which can work well in other projects.

Using proper formatting and comments this project is very readable and can be easily understood by other programmers.
