Project 2 Banking {

This project helps people understand compound interest and how their investments can grow over time. 

A part that I think I did well is allowing the options to update info without having to restart the program. 
You can change anything using the menu options and imediately see how it effects the investment.

A part that I think could be improved upon is that if you enter an input other than a number it can break the loop. 
I tried to find a way around this, but at the time it would have taken too much time to fix this problem.

I think it is a very well organized project and makes good use of functions and loops which can work well in other projects.

Using proper formatting and comments this project is very readable and can be easily understood by other programmers.

Draw it or Lose it { This project was to design a web based game called "Draw it or Lose it" for "The Gaming Room." This game would be played between multiple platforms and be designed for browser play. 
In this documentation I think I did a good job at getting a lot of detail in there outlining everything that was needeing to be done which also helped with the code design because I just had to translate things over.
I think my reccomendations portion could be a little longer. Though i do get a good amount of detail in there it might not be as straight forward to someone who doesn't program. 
I tried to look at the user's needs as If I was the one playing the game. This is important because without good user interaction then the game won't be successful. 
This approach makes it easier to test your software as well because as a programmer you aren't thinking of how the game might mess up, you are thinking about if everything was perfect.

DriverPass System { 
This system was designed to give people a better chance at learning the rules of the road and being able to pass a test at the DMV with more confidence. The client was DriverPass and they wanted a web based system that could support both online courses and in person driving appointments for customers.
I think that my UML diagrams were lined out particularly well compared to my actual explanations. Im more of a visual person when it comes to this kind of work so I'm able to design those diagrams better.
I think that my written descriptions could be better. A lot of them I just kind of said what was allready on my diagrams, which might make it harder for a non programmer to understand. I think I could focus more on the simplistic view when explaining.
When designing this sytem almost everything was based somewhat around the users needs. Obviously a system can't be perfect but the client is paying you to do a job so you want to do it as close to the instructions as possible to make them happy.
When designing the software I thought of it as if I was the customer. This system is almost entirely based on the customers needs so those portions of the system needed to be priority. This involved good security, easy communication, and a system they could use from home.
